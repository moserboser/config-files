# Configuration files fedora-sway spin

## **Important**
These files are not optimized for other users! Some paths will not work on your system. GTK themes have to be installed manually // 
The folder is set up to be used with [stow](https://github.com/aspiers/stow). If you want to apply the config files to your own machine it is however recommended to copy them manually.
For the sway-wm config file you download the content of the folder `sway/.config/sway`. And place them in `~/.config/sway/`.
